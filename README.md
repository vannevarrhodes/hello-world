They are Wrong

What goes up often comes down
What goes left often goes right
What goes in often goes out
Folks often think they are right
Folks should often consider
                           they are wrong
## Branching like a tree
How the tree knows where to grow a branch
How the kid knows how to play
How the man knows how to stand erect
Like a telephone pole
